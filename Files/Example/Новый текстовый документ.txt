Human Readable Size
Finally – let’s see how to get a more user readable representation of the file size using Apache Commons IO – not just a size in bytes:

@Test
public void whenGetReadableFileSize_thenCorrect() {
    File imageFile = new File("src/test/resources/image.jpg");
    long size = getFileSize(imageFile);
 
    assertEquals("12 KB", FileUtils.byteCountToDisplaySize(size));
}
6. Conclusion
In this tutorial, we illustrated examples of using Java and Apache Commons IO to calculate the size of a file in the file system.

The implementation of these examples can be found in the GitHub project – this is a Maven-based project, so it should be easy to import and run as it is.
