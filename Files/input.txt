In this quick tutorial, we'll learn how to get the size of a file in Java – using Java 7, the new Java 8 and Apache Common IO.

Finally – we will also get a human readable representation of the file size.

2. Standard Java IO
Let’s start with a simple example of calculating the size of a file – using the File.length() method:

private long getFileSize(File file) {
    long length = file.length();
    return length;
}
We can test our implementation relatively simply:

@Test
public void whenGetFileSize_thenCorrect() {
    long expectedSize = 12607;
 
    File imageFile = new File("src/test/resources/image.jpg");
    long size = getFileSize(imageFile);
 
    assertEquals(expectedSize, size);
}
Note that, by default, the file sizes is calculated in bytes.
